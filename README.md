## Reflection

This personal project idea came to me when I needed a tool to help me organise my thoughts properly. So I decided to build a todo list app implemented in a chrome extension as I use chrome a lot.

The main challenge of this project was implementing ***chrome sync storage api*** into the application but couldn't because the api wasn't pulling the data fast enough before the page had loaded so instead, I chnged to ***chrome local storage api***. Another challenge was changing the appearance of the application to make it somewhat appealing.

Technologies used:

* Javascript
* Html
* Css
